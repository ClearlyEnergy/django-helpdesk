<h2>Email Templates</h2>
<p>Here you can edit email templates sent out from Helpdesk. They are triggered by specific actions, and so they cannot be created or deleted.</p>
<p><b>Name</b> describes the action triggering that template to send, and the type of user it's sent to.</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        Actions:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Assigned</b>: the ticket has been assigned to a new staff member (only sent to staff users</li>
            <li><b>Closed</b>: the ticket has been closed, possibly with a resolution</li>
            <li><b>Escalated</b>: the ticket has been automatically escalated (this is not used by most jurisdictions)</li>
            <li><b>New ticket</b>: the ticket has just been created in the system</li>
            <li><b>Resolved</b>: the ticket has been marked "Resolved," possibly with a resolution. Anyone copied on the ticket can then visit the link and "accept and close" the ticket.</li>
            <li><b>Updated</b>: the ticket has been updated, typically with a comment</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        User roles:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Submitter</b>: the user who submitted the ticket, and whose email address is in the "submitter" field of the ticket.</li>
            <li><b>Owner</b>: the assigned user</li>
            <li><b>CC Public</b>: an address that has been copied on the ticket, but is not a staff member in Helpdesk</li>
            <li><b>CC User</b>: a staff user that has been copied on the ticket</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
<p><b>Subject Line Suffix</b> is added to the end of the email's subject line. ex: "[ticket-123] I have a query <b>(Opened)</b>"</p>
<p><b>Heading</b> describes the email's content.</p>
<p><b>Plain Text Body</b> is the content of the email, sent when the HTML cannot be loaded. No HTML tags can be used here.</p>
<p><b>HTML Body</b> is the content of the email using HTML. This is typically what will be received in inboxes.</p>
<p>No sign-off is needed; each email is automatically signed with the name of the queue and the sender email address.</p>
